//Always start with Backend logic for a full stack project
//initialize a node project
//put a package.json file
//Goto your Backend folder in terminal and type npm init to initialize a package.json
//when we type npm install <packageName> it actually brings those packages from central node repository which is internet to your local machine for use
//fs module is part of node js but to use express, jsonwebtoken we actually need to bring it from internet to your local setup(machine)
